# yaraQA
YARA rule Analyzer to improve rule quality and performance

## Why?

YARA rules can be syntactically correct but still dysfunctional. yaraQA tries to find and report these issues to the author or maintainer of a YARA rule set.

The issues yaraQA tries to detect are e.g.:

- rules that are syntactically correct but never match due to errors in the condition (e.g. rule with one string and `2 of them` in the condition)
- rules that use string and modifier combinations that are probably wrong (e.g. `$ = "\\Debug\\" fullword`)
- performance issues caused by short atoms, repeating characters or loops (e.g. `$ = "AA"`; can be excluded from the analysis using `--ignore-performance`)

I'm going to extend the test set over time. Each minor version will include new features or new tests.

## Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
usage: yaraQA.py [-h] [-f yara files [yara files ...]] [-d yara files [yara files ...]] [-o outfile] [-b baseline] [-l level]
                 [--ignore-performance] [--debug]

YARA RULE ANALYZER

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f yara files [yara files ...]
                        Path to input files (one or more YARA rules, separated by space)
  -d yara files [yara files ...]
                        Path to input directory (YARA rules folders, separated by space)
  -o outfile            Output file that lists the issues (JSON, default: 'yaraQA-issues.json') 
  -b baseline           Use a issues baseline (issues found and reviewed before) to filter issues
  -l level              Minium level to show (1=informational, 2=warning, 3=critical)
  --ignore-performance  Suppress performance-related rule issues
  --debug               Debug output
```

## Try it out

```bash
python3 yaraQA.py -d ./test/
```

Suppress all performance issues and only show detection / logic issues.
```bash
python3 yaraQA.py -d ./test/ --ignore-performance
```

Suppress all issues of informational character
```bash
python3 yaraQA.py -d ./test/ -level 2
```

Use a baseline to only see new issues (not the ones that you've already reviewed). The baseline file is an old JSON output of a reviewed state.

```bash
python3 yaraQA.py -d ./test/ -b yaraQA-reviewed-issues.json
```

## Example Rules with Issues

Example rules with issues can be found in the `./test` folder.

## Output

yaraQA writes the detected issues to a file named `yaraQA-issues.json` by default.

This listing shows an example of the output generated by yaraQA in JSON format:
